Gratitude's Small Form

A lion injured his paw on sharp thorns while hunting. The wound became infected, and pain consumed him. A wise ant stumbled upon the injured king of beasts. Using ancient knowledge, the ant gathered medicinal herbs and applied them carefully. The ant remained vigilant, protecting the lion from scavengers at night. Within two weeks, the wound healed completely. The ant's tiny size had allowed access to places the lion couldn't reach himself. The lion bowed before his savior, understanding that true greatness lies in compassion and the willingness to help others, regardless of their size.
