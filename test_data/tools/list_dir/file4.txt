The Bond of Kings

A lion faced his greatest challenge—a rival lion threatened his territory. Wounded and exhausted, the proud lion retreated. An ant, once saved by this very lion, stepped forward. The ant rallied thousands of companions, creating a massive swarm that distracted and confused the rival. The strategic distraction gave the lion precious moments to recover and regain his strength. With renewed vigor, the lion defeated his opponent. The ant sat atop the victor's mane as they returned home. A king learned that true strength means accepting help and remembering those who stood by you.
