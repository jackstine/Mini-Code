When Giants Fall

A prideful lion, weakened by old age, could no longer hunt. Starvation threatened his survival. A humble ant noticed the suffering giant and felt compassion. The ant organized food storage, leading a foraging team to bring provisions. They constructed a shelter from elements the lion could manage. The ant provided companionship during lonely nights. Through winter, the ant's community sustained the failing lion. When the lion's time came to rest, he looked upon his tiny friend with profound gratitude. His legacy became a monument to kindness: never underestimate the power of small acts of love.
