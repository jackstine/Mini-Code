The Ant and the Lion

A mighty lion was trapped in a hunter's net, roaring with frustration. A tiny ant, wandering nearby, heard the desperate cries. Without hesitation, the ant began gnawing at the thick net with determination. Hour after hour, the ant worked tirelessly, chewing through rope fiber by fiber. Finally, the net tore apart, and the lion broke free. The grateful lion bowed his great head to the small ant, realizing that size doesn't determine courage or worth. From that day forward, they became unlikely friends.
