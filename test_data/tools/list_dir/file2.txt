A Tiny Hero's Gift

The lion lay weakened by fever in the scorching savanna. An ant colony discovered him and decided to help. Thousands of ants worked together, bringing water droplets on leaves to his parched mouth. They gathered seeds and fruits, arranging them within his reach. The ant queen personally supervised the rescue mission. Days passed, and the lion's strength slowly returned. When he finally stood, fully recovered, the ant queen climbed onto his shoulder. The lion roared gratefully, a sound that echoed across the entire savanna, honoring his smallest healers.
